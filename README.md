# LUAD_survival_analysis
#This project demonstrates how to use R for real-world evidence (RWE) analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using the GEO dataset GSE68465.

#I focused on the EGFR gene, a clinically relevant biomarker in lung cancer, to:

#Prepare and clean clinical + expression data

#Perform Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis

#Run Cox proportional hazards models (univariable + multivariable)

#Generate publication-style figures (KM curves, risk tables, forest plots)

#Combine plots into a reproducible panel

#This repo is designed to highlight data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility skills rather than to provide novel biological findings.
